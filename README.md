#Fm.EHF

##Description

EHFUtility is a .NET-library to simplify EHF-related tasks in .NET. Use this utility to:
- Validate EHF-documents using DIFIs validationservice
- Send EHF-documents 
- Perform SMP and SML lookup

What you canâ€™t do with this library:
- Receive PEPPOL-documents (Oxalis is a complete access point which can receive documents and send documents (java-lib or command-line))
- Generate EHF-xml. If you want to generate .NET-classes for EHF-Invoice: download XSD-schemas from DIFIs VEFaValidator-tool and use Xsd2Code or other tool

EHFUtility uses a modified version of PEPPOLs [START-library] (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/svn/peppol/dev/infrastructure/sample_implementations/dotnet/start/) (upgraded from .NET 3.5 to 4.5 with integrated support for claims) to send PEPPOL documents. Validation is performed using DIFIs validationservice [VEFA validator](http://vefa.difi.no) which is being developed by [Difi](http://www.difi.no).


##INSTALLATION (short version):
1. Add NuGet-package
2. Install PEPPOL root certificates into trusted root certification authorities
3. Create keystore with your private key and certificate issued by PEPPOL
4. Modify app.config/web.config

Long version: coming soon...
